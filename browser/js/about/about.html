		  			<h2>Jason Olivo</h2>
		  			<p>Born and raised in Queens, New York, I am the Commissioner of the Your Favorite
					Team Sucks fantasy football league. We are now entering our eighth year and still going
					strong. I have played fantasy football for over ten years and have won many leagues, but
					I have never been crowned the champion in the league that matters to me the most. I am a
					lifelong Tennessee Titans fan, which is just as depressing as me not winning in my own
					league.</p>

		  			<h2>Jack Li</h2>
		  			<p>I was born and raised in New York City. My favorite team is the Philadelphia Eagles, and
					hopefully the day will come where I can celebrate a Super Bowl win. I have been playing
					fantasy football for over 12 years now and it has been one of my favorite hobbies. In our
					fantasy league, I have won 3 out of the 7 years we have played together so I guess I
					should be the one you should listen to the most.</p>

		  			<h2>Amoni Wells</h2>
		  			<p>My name is Amoni Wells, I am originally from Queens, NY but currently reside in
					Yonkers. I have been playing fantasy football since 2011. However seeing as how I had
					no idea what I was doing, or anything to do with football for that matter - we can all
					agree that that year didn't count (flashback triggered). I am a die-hard Dallas Cowboys
					fan, and that is putting it lightly. Only thing I am missing are the face tattoos. Why my
					team sucks you might ask? That's simple; they don't. They are the greatest team in the
					NFL and are. wait for it.... America's Team. Yes, I am one of those. Yes, I understand
					how much that annoys you. No, I don't care.</p>

		  			<h2>Eddie Torres</h2>
		  			<p>5'7/165 runs a 4.6 with a vertical of 32".  Slow, but quick in space. Has the ability to get open, but is a small target and hard to find at times. Better as a slot man as he causes mismatches with linebackers and safeties. Has enough speed to get behind the defense. Projected late fourth round. One of Your Favorite Team Sucks fantasy experts. Been playing fantasy football for about 12-13 years now and play in about 5-6 leagues yearly. One of the original members of the YFTS expert league as well as a back-to-back 2-time champ. Sports is life, but probably more passionate about fantasy football than anything else (I know sad right?). You, the audience, should expect strong and arguably questionable assurances from the beginning to the end of the fantasy football season made by yours truly. </p>

		  			<h2>Nicholas Brosnan</h2>
		  			<p>Growing up a sports fan, I was introduced to fantasy sports in 2002. I've played a wide range of fantasy games, before narrowing it down to Football, Baseball, Basketball, and Premier League fantasy. I am the current defending champion and one of three members to win the Your Favorite Team Sucks league.</p>
